Step 1 : Put on your seatbelt. In most places in the world, driving without wearing a seatbelt is illegal.
Step 2 : Always start your car with your foot on the brake. When you turn it on, the car will move forward by itself if your foot isn't on the brake.    
Step 3 : Turn on the engine and release the parking brake, if necessary
Step 4 : When you're ready to move your car forwards, come to a complete stop and put the car into 'Drive'
Step 5 : Hold both hands on the steering wheel at the '9 and 3 o'clock' position.
Step 6 : Use your blinkers (also called indicators or turn signals)
Happy Driving !!
